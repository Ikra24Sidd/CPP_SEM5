1. MAP IS A CONTAINER WHICH STORES THE VALUES IN FORM OF KEY VALUE PAIR
2. The values in a map can be duplicate, but the keys of the map should always be unique
3. If we try to add a key value pair in a map , for an already existing key-
	3.1 Using assignment operator- it will change the previous value associated with that key
	3.2 Using insert function- it will not change the previous value for the existing key
4. Insert function will only work if the key is not already present in the map, otherwise it 
    will not have change on the existing value
5. By default, the elements in a map are printed in ascending order of the key
